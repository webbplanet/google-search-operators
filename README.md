## Basic Operators

These are the most commonly used operators.

*   **`" "` (Quotes)**
    *   **Purpose:** Searches for the exact phrase within the quotes.
    *   **How to use:** Enclose your specific phrase in double quotes.
    *   **Example:** `"how to install python on windows"` - Finds pages containing that exact sequence of words.

*   **`-` (Minus Sign / Exclude)**
    *   **Purpose:** Excludes results containing a specific word or phrase (immediately following the minus sign).
    *   **How to use:** Place the `-` symbol directly before the word you want to exclude (no space).
    *   **Example:** `jaguar speed -car` - Finds information about the jaguar animal's speed, excluding results about the Jaguar car brand.
    *   **Example:** `web development -"web design"` - Finds pages about web development but excludes those mentioning "web design".

*   **`OR` or `|` (Pipe)**
    *   **Purpose:** Searches for results containing *either* one term *or* another. `OR` must be capitalized. The pipe `|` symbol achieves the same result.
    *   **How to use:** Place `OR` (in uppercase) or `|` between search terms.
    *   **Example:** `javascript OR python` - Finds pages containing either "javascript" or "python" (or both).
    *   **Example:** `react | vue tutorial` - Finds tutorials for either React or Vue.

*   **`*` (Wildcard)**
    *   **Purpose:** Acts as a placeholder for one or more unknown words within a phrase. Often used with `" "`.
    *   **How to use:** Place the `*` where you want a word or words to be substituted.
    *   **Example:** `"the * programming language"` - Could find "the Go programming language", "the Rust programming language", etc.
    *   **Example:** `largest * in the world` - Could find "largest animal in the world", "largest city in the world", etc.

*   **`( )` (Parentheses / Grouping)**
    *   **Purpose:** Groups multiple terms or operators to control how the search is executed, especially with `OR`.
    *   **How to use:** Enclose the terms/operators you want to group within parentheses.
    *   **Example:** `(react OR vue) tutorial -angular` - Finds tutorials for React or Vue, but excludes results mentioning Angular.

*   **`..` (Range)**
    *   **Purpose:** Searches for numbers within a specific range (years, prices, measurements, etc.).

## Less Common / Potentially Deprecated Operators

These operators may have limited functionality or might not work consistently as Google changes its algorithms. Use with caution.

*   **`related:`**
    *   **Purpose:** Finds websites related to a specific URL. Functionality can be inconsistent.
    *   **How to use:** `related:url`
    *   **Example:** `related:google.com`

*   **`info:` or `id:`**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides information Google has about a specific URL (cache, related pages, pages linking to it, etc.). Functionality can be inconsistent. `id:` is an alias.
    *   **How to use:** `info:url`
    *   **Example:** `info:github.com`

*   **`link:`**
    *   **Purpose:** *Historically* used to find pages linking to a specific URL. Google has officially stated this operator is **deprecated** for finding *all* backlinks. It might still show a small, non-representative sample, or primarily links from your own sites if using Search Console. Don't rely on it for comprehensive backlink analysis.
    *   **How to use:** `link:url`
    *   **Example:** `link:example.com` (results may be limited/unreliable)

*   **`~` (Tilde / Synonym)**
    *   **Purpose:** *Historically* used to include synonyms for a word. Google now incorporates synonyms automatically much more effectively, making this operator largely redundant.
    *   **How to use:** `~word`
    *   **Example:** `~fast car` (likely behaves the same as `fast car` now)

*   **`+` (Plus Sign / Force Include)**
    *   **Purpose:** *Historically* used to force the inclusion of common words (stop words like "a", "the", "is") that Google might otherwise ignore. This functionality is now largely achieved using `""` (exact phrase). **Deprecated.**
    *   **How to use:** `+word` (obsolete)
    *   **Example:** `star +wars` (use `"star wars"` instead)

*   **`daterange:`**
    *   **Purpose:** Searches within a specific date range using Julian dates. This is notoriously difficult to use correctly and often less effective than using the "Tools" -> "Any time" filter in Google's interface. Requires Julian date format.
    *   **How to use:** `search terms daterange:startdate-enddate` (dates in Julian format)
    *   **Example:** `brexit news daterange:24588
